# datatype-linkedlist
Repository will contains linked list implementation and solving real time problem with Linked list. This implementation will come with Test driven development, easy to run and no third party tools. Its plain algorithms. It mainly concentrates on time and space complexity. We will look into problems from multiple paradigms.

## User story
1. User can insert elements in linked list

Scenario​: As a User, I want to get length of linked list 
```
Given​ :  there are no elements in linked list 
When​ : length of linked list
Then​ : length will be zero

Given​ :  insert element in empty/non-empty linked list 
When​ : length of linked list 
Then​ : length will be non zero, increasing and new element added as HEAD in linked list
```
